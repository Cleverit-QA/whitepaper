[id="new-changed"]
= Key features

{PRODUCT} is a platform for developing and deploying enterprise integration solutions.
It is hosted and managed by Red Hat so you can focus on building applications, not infrastructure.
{PRODUCT_SHORT} enables your team to develop, build, and deploy enterprise integration solutions on an OpenShift Dedicated cluster managed by Red Hat

*Services:* Integration capabilities and services which are fully hosted and managed integration components that are pre-installed and pre-configured on an OpenShift Dedicated cluster. The products available as services are:

* API management ({three-scale-name})
* Enterprise connectivity ({fuse-short-name})
* Messaging ({amq-online-name})
* Single sign-on ({rhsso-name})
* Integrated development environment ({code-ready-name})

*Solution Patterns:* Pre-developed Solution Patterns demonstrate best practices and help development teams get started quickly. You can create additional Solution Patterns to standardize best practices.

*Solution Explorer:* A unified front-end web application that provides access to the installed products, development tools, Solution Patterns, and the Red Hat OpenShift console.

Technical preview features are not enabled by default in {PRODUCT} clusters. For example, the Internet of Things (IoT) feature of AMQ Online is not enabled. Any exceptions are labeled in the Solution Explorer.

* If email addresses are not available as part of your IdP configuration, you cannot receive 3scale email notifications.
To work around this issue, you must:
